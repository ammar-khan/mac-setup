### Ruby Environment
---

#### Installation
```
brew install rbenv ruby-build rbenv-default-gems rbenv-gemset
```

```
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/Projects/config/env.sh
```

Execute the following command to determine your shell:
```
echo $0
```
You’ll see either `bash` or `zsh`.

If you’re using ZSH, you’ll open the file `~/.zshrc` in your editor:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you’re using the Bash shell, you’ll use the file `~/.bash_profile`:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Switching versions
We can install version 2.1.1 and use it as our global version by running:

```
rbenv install 2.1.1
```

```
rbenv global 2.1.1
```
