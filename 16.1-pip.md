### PIP
---
Package Installer for Python is the de facto and recommended package-management system written in Python and is used to install and manage software packages. It connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index.

> MacOS comes with Python so there's a chance pip is already installed on your machine.

#### Installation
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
```
```
sudo python get-pip.py
```

To verify `pip` is installed properly run
```
pip --version
```

#### Usage
Here are a few `pip` commands to get you started.

Install a `Python` package
```
pip install <package>
```

Upgrade a package
```
pip install --upgrade <package>
```

See what's installed
```
pip freeze
```

Uninstall a package
```
pip uninstall <package>
```

#### Upgrade
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

>Executable scripts from Python packages you install will be put in `/usr/local/share/python`, make sure it's on your `PATH`.
