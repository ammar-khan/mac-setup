[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates. 

List of available [candidates](https://sdkman.io/sdks)

#### Installation
```
 curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```
>Follow the instructions on-screen to complete installation. Next, open a new terminal or enter:

```
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Lastly, run the following code snippet to ensure that installation succeeded:

```
sdk version
```
> sdkman 5.0.0+51

#### Usage

##### Installing an SDK
Latest Stable
```
sdk install java
```

##### List all versions of java 
```
sdk list java
```

##### List instaled candidates
```
sdk list
```

##### Use version
```
sdk use java 8
```

##### Default version
```
sdk default java 11
```

##### Current version of Java
```
sdk current java
```
> Using java version 17.0.4-tem

##### Currently versions for all Candidates:
```
$ sdk current
Using:
groovy: 4.0.4
java: 17.0.4-tem
scala: 3.1.3
```

##### Maintain environment
Want to switch to a specific JDK or SDK every time you visit a project? This can be achieved through an `.sdkmanrc` file in the base directory of your project. This file can be generated automatically by issuing the following command:

```
sdk env init
```
A config file with the following content has now been created in the current directory:
```
# Enable auto-env through the sdkman_auto_env config
# Add key=value pairs of SDKs to use below
java=17.0.4-tem
```

The file is pre-populated with the current JDK version in use, but can contain as may key-value pairs of supported SDKs as needed. To switch to the configuration present in your `.sdkmanrc` file, simply issue the following command:
```
sdk env
```
>Using java version 17.0.4-tem in this shell.

Your path has now also been updated to use any of these SDKs in your current shell. When leaving a project, you may want to reset the SDKs to their default version. This can be achieved by entering:

```
sdk env clear
```
>Restored java version to 17.0.4-tem (default)

After checking out a new project, you may be missing some SDKs specified in the project's `.sdkmanr`c file. To install these missings SDKs, just type:
```
sdk env install
```

##### SDKMAN! version
```
sdk version
```
