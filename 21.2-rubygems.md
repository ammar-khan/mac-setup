### RubyGems
---
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/), the Ruby package manager, should be installed on your machine if you previously have installed Ruby. Verify this by running:

#### Verify RubyGems
```
which gem
```

#### Update RubyGems
```
gem update --system
```
#### Install gems
```
gem install <gemname>
```
```
gem install <gemname> --no-document
```

#### List installed gems
```
gem list
```

#### To check if any installed gems are outdated:
```
gem outdated
```

#### Update installed gems
```
gem update <gemname>
```

#### Remove old gem versions
```
gem cleanup
```

#### Managing gems in application
Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

```
gem install bundler
```

```
echo 'bundler' >> "$(brew --prefix rbenv)/default-gems"
```

When starting a Ruby project, you can have sandboxed collections of gems. This lets you have multiple collections of gems installed in different sandboxes, and specify (on a per-application basis) which sets of gems should be used. To have gems install into a sub-folder in your project directory for easy later removal / editing / testing, you can use a project gemset.

```
echo '.gems' > <my_project_path>/.rbenv-gemsets
```

>Your gems will then get installed in `project/.gems`

#### Configuration
If you use Google for finding your Gem documentation then you might want to consider saving a bit of time when installing gems by not including the documentation.
```
echo 'gem: --no-document' >> ~/.gemrc
```
