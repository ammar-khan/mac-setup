### SSH Config for GitHub
---
These instructions are for those who wish to use SSH and not HTTPS, and are from the official [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

#### Check for existing SSH keys
```
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
> Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either `id_rsa.pub` or `id_dsa.pub`. If you don't have either of those files then read on, otherwise skip the next section.

#### Generate a new SSH key
If you don't have an SSH key you need to generate one. To do that you need to run the commands below, and make sure to substitute the placeholder with your email. The default settings are preferred, so when you're asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just press Enter to continue.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```
> Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label

#### Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

If you're running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain:
```
Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account
Let GitHub know about your SSH key so GitHub can recognize you

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then go to GitHub and [input your new SSH key](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new). Paste your key in the `Key` text-box and pick a name that represents the computer you're currently using.

> We are now ready to use SSH with GitHub!
