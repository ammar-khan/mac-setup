### Pyenv
---
[pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) is a Python version manager that can manage and install different versions of Python.

>Installing Python also installs [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (and its dependency [Setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)), which is the package manager for Python.

#### Installation
```
brew install pyenv
```

Execute the following command to determine your shell:
```
echo $0
```
You’ll see either `bash` or `zsh`.

If you’re using ZSH, you’ll open the file `~/.zshrc` in your editor:
```
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If you’re using the Bash shell, you’ll use the file `~/.bash_profile`:
```
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Restart your shell to make sure the path changes take effect.
```
exec $SHELL
```

#### Usage
You can now begin using `pyenv`. 
To list the all available versions of Python, including Anaconda, Jython, PyPy and Stackless:

```
pyenv install --list
```

Then install the desired versions:
```
pyenv install 2.7.12
pyenv install 3.5.2
```

Use the global command to set global version(s) of Python to be used in all shells. 
For example, if you prefer 2.7.12 over 3.5.2:
```
pyenv global 2.7.12 3.5.2
pyenv rehash
```

The leading version takes priority. 
All installed Python versions can be located in `~/.pyenv/versions`. 
Alternatively, you can run:
```
$ pyenv versions

system (set by /Users/your_account/.pyenv/version)
* 2.7.12
* 3.5.2
```
> This shows an asterisk * next to the currently active version.

#### Application Specific Python version
The `local` command will set local application specific Python version(s) by writing the version name to a `.python-version` file in the current directory. This version overrides the global version. For example, to install anaconda3-4.1.1 in `path/to/directory`:
```
$ pyenv install anaconda3-4.1.1
$ cd path/to/directory
$ pyenv local anaconda3-4.1.1
$ pyenv rehash
$ pyenv versions
  system
  2.7.12
  3.5.2
* anaconda3-4.1.1 (set by /Users/your_account/path/to/directory/.python-version)
```

#### Upgrade
```
brew upgrade pyenv
```
