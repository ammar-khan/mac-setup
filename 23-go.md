### Go
---

[Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.


#### Installation

You can follow the official [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) on how to install Go, or you can use Homebrew instead:

```
brew install go
```

#### Verify
```
go version
```
> go version go1.11.4 darwin/amd64

#### The GOPATH and PATH environment variables
The `GOPATH` environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. It defaults to a directory named `go` inside your home directory (`$HOME/go`).

If you really want to change your `GOPATH` to something else add GOPATH to your shell/bash/zsh initialization file `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

```
export GOPATH=/something-else
```

Add `GOPATH/bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable so you can run `Go` programs anywhere.

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Make sure to re-source source `.bash_profile` your current session or simply open new tab within iTerm.

#### Format your code
To format a single file:

```
gofmt -w yourcode.go
```

You can also format an entire package
```
go fmt path/to/your/package
```

#### Generate documentation
With the `godoc` command you can generate documentation from your code and read documentation from other packages.

Documentation for package fmt
```
godoc fmt
```

Documentation for fmt.Printf
```
godoc fmt Printf
```

fmt package interface in Go source form
```
godoc -src fmt 
```

Documentation for all packages on your machine served through http http://localhost:1234
```
godoc -all -http :1234
```
