### Node Version Manager
---

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL.

#### Installation

```
brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node
```

```
brew uninstall --force node
```

Download and install nvm by running:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

OR

```
brew install nvm
```

> See the [documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for information

```
vim ~/.bash_profile
```
OR
```
vim ~/.zshrc
```

Append following:
```
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --preix nvm)/nvm.sh
```
> Press ESC + :wq to save and close file

Execute the following command to determine your shell:
```
echo $0
```
You’ll see either `bash` or `zsh`.

If you’re using ZSH, you’ll open the file `~/.zshrc` in your editor:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

If you’re using the Bash shell, you’ll use the file `~/.bash_profile`:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Check the nvm use message
```
command -v nvm
```

#### Install most recent Node stable version
```
nvm install node
```

```
nvm install 14
```

#### list installed Node version
```
nvm ls 
```

#### Use stable as current version
```
nvm use node
```

```
nvm use 14
```

#### List all the Node versions you can install
```
nvm ls-remote
```

#### Set the installed stable version as the default Node
```
nvm alias default node
```
