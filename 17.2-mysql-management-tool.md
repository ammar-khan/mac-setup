### MySQL Management Application
---
It is always nice to have a GUI tool for managing databases. For Mac, you can use [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) to manage local and remote MySQL databases. It is a free tool, you can choose to donate to support the development.

#### Installation
```
brew install --cask sequel-pro
```
