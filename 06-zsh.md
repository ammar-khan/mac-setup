### Z Shell
---
The Z shell (also known as zsh) is a Unix shell that is built on top of bash (the default shell for macOS) with additional features. It's recommended to use zsh over bash. It's also highly recommended to install a framework with zsh as it makes dealing with configuration, plugins and themes a lot nicer.

#### Installation
```
brew install zsh
```

Now you should install a framework, we recommend to use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) or [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto). Note that you should pick one of them, not use both.

The configuration file for zsh is called `.zshrc` and lives in your home folder `~/.zshrc`.
