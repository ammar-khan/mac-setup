### Xcode
---
Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment for macOS, used to develop software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

#### Prerequisite 
- Xcode only runs on a mac. If you are on a PC, sadly you won't be able to use Xcode.
- You'll need a good, stable internet connection. The latest version is around 8 gigabytes in size.
- Be sure to have at least 30 gigabytes of free space on your computer. The latest .xip file (v11.4.1 at the time of writing) is ~8 gigabytes zipped. When you unzip it, that's another 17 gigabytes. Then you'll need the command line tool, which is yet another 1.5 gigabytes.

#### Installation
Download and install it from the App Store or from Apple's website.

If you have never installed Xcode before, you may be able to update with your Terminal by typing in
```
xcode-select --install
```
> If you have an existing version of Xcode installed on your machine, you'll probably see this error:
```
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use “Software Update” to install updates
```
This means you'll need to go to the developer website instead.
