### Oh My Zsh
---
Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. It comes with a bunch of features out of the box and improves your terminal experience.

#### Installation:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

The installation script should set zsh to your default shell, but if it doesn't you can do it manually:

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

#### Configuration
The out-of-the-box configuration is usable but you probably want to customise it to suit your needs. The [Official Wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki) contains a lot of useful information if you want to deep dive into what you can do with Oh My Zsh, but we'll cover the basics here.

To apply the changes you make you need to either start new shell instance or run:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Plugins
Add plugins to your shell by adding the name of the plugin to the plugin array in your `.zshrc`.

```
plugins=(git colored-man-pages colorize pip python brew osx)
```

>You'll find a list of all plugins on the Oh My Zsh [Wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins). Note that adding plugins can cause your shell startup time to increase.

##### zsh-syntax-highlighting
The Syntax Highlighting plugin adds beautiful colors to the commands you are typing.

Clone the zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin’s repo and copy it to the “Oh My ZSH” plugins directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

##### zsh-autosuggestions
This plugin auto suggests any of the previous commands. Pretty handy! To select the completion, simply press → key.

Clone the zsh-autosuggestions plugin’s repo and copy it to the “Oh My ZSH” plugins directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

##### Apply Changes
To apply the changes you make you need to either start new shell instance or run:

```

```

##### Themes
Changing theme is as simple as changing a string in your configuration file. The default theme is `robbyrussell`. Just change that value to change theme, and don't forget to apply your changes.

```
ZSH_THEME=pygmalion
```
