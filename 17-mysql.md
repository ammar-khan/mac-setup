### MySQL
---
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

#### Installation
We will install `MySQL` using Homebrew, which will also install some header files needed for MySQL bindings in different programming languages (MySQL-Python for one).

>Sequel Pro does not support latest MySQL (version 8), because of that you may want to install MySQL 5.7 instead - `brew install mysql@5.7`.

```
brew install mysql
```
