### AWS Single Sign-On
---

AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is a cloud service that allows you to grant your users access to AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, across multiple AWS accounts.

#### Configuration
```
aws configure sso
```
This will ask `SSO start URL` and `SSO Region`


>SSO start URL [None]: https://your-url.awsapps.com/start
>
>SSO Region [None]: us-east-1
 
>This step will take you to the browser and you will have to click login and allow

After that you will be ask few more questions to setup a profile (user arrow keys to select if multiple)

>There are 6 AWS accounts available to you.
>
>Using the account ID xxxxxxxxxxxx
>
>The only role available to you is: AdministratorAccess
>
>Using the role name "AdministratorAccess"
>
>CLI default client Region [None]: us-east-1
>
>CLI default output format [None]: json
>
>CLI profile name [AdministratorAccess-xxxxxxxxxxxx]: cq-dev-admin

#### Verify
```
aws s3 ls --profile cq-dev-admin
```

#### Multiple SSO Profiles
Edit `~/.aws/config`

```
[profile profile-name-1]
sso_start_url = https://xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = yyyyyyy
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess

sso_start_url = https://xxxxxx.awsapps.com/start/
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = yyyyyyy
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = eu-central-1
```

#### Login

aws sso login --profile profile-name-1
```
